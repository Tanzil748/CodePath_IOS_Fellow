Submitted by: **Tanzil Hassan**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total  

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Added dark mode screen function
- [ ] Added "Settings" tab. Named it "COVID Reminder" to list general covid guidelines. Figure the user of this app is dining outdoors so this feature would prove useful.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-I tried to move dark mode option to settings tab (labeled COVID Reminder), didn't work. Build did not function and my app occasionally began crashing. 
-Implementing slider into the tips section. Learned how to adjust the limits and initial value, but had trouble connecting it to the swiftlearner file.
-Keyboard occasionally did not pop up in app. Problem was solved after CMD + K
-I had issues with coloring my app and making it compatible with dark mode. Did some research, concluded tertiaryColor and secondaryColor as possible solution.
-Finding out a way to autosize my app screen and make it compatible with all devices, regardless of model year. Sometimes comes out too big in really old models.
-For future projects, I'd like to figure out a way to make an app logo size-compatible with all models faster. I had to manually filter the pictures one by one to fit the respective slot.
